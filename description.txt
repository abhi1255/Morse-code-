Project Details:
Topic - Morse code translator 
Description - The code takes input in the form of morse code using the
mouse. Left click for dot, right click for dash and middle mouse button for space.
After input is taken, it establishes connection with another pc using sockets and
gives you the required translation for the code.All this is done with proper GUI

inputting morse code using mouse:
-must write a dictionary mapping each letter,number and punctuation to its morse
translation
-must implement GUI for this code

displaying the input:
-code for diplaying what the user has input in the GUI 

hosting connection between two pcs using sockets:
-one part of the code runs the socket code on both the pcs establishing a secure connection
-morse code is sent in the form of a text file

decoding the message:
-use the same dictionary to extract the characters from the given morse code
-file is read and dislpayed on a window

more code asking if the user wants to send another message or terminate the program
if yes execute the code again
else terminate the connection

The project consists of two modules, sender and reciever. The sender accepts data in morse code format and
transmits it to the remote reciever. The reciever will then decode the data and display it.
